# CAHTester
In 2019, I was hired as a part-time contributing writer for Cards Against Humanity. For the unintiated, the game consists of black cards, that are either a question, or a sentence with a blank in it. Players then play white cards to fill that blank, hoping to come up with the funniest combination.\
In the writers room, the game's staff writers keep a stack of black cards to "test" a white card idea, to see if it fits into the game's grammar and has the potential to be funny.\
As a remote contributor, I decided to write a Python script that would take my input, a white card idea, and return a stack of black cards with my idea replacing the blank.\
Running this script in a terminal, this script was actually how I tested my ideas for white cards.\
Although I no longer contribute to the game, I'd like to make a nice GUI for this. Currently, there's a Django project inside of the repo, but that feels like overkill for such a simple project. This project is currently on the back burner, but I will probably end up using Flask for it.
